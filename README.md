## Milestones

* Milestone 01 - Drawing Dynamic Constructions

* Milestone 02 - Static Game

* Milestone 03 - Basic Building
  * [x] Add Menu HUD to allow the player to select which construction to build
  * [x] Add the construction when the player selected a build location
  * [x] Add a connection to the closest construction
  * [x] Add a connection to any construction in the range
  * [x] Building a new construction consumes material
  * [x] Prevent building if influence areas overlap
  * [x] Disallow crossing connections
  * [ ] Prevent construction to overlap with connections

* Milestone 04 - Active Connections
  * [x] Visualize the energy flow in a connection by increasing the line width
  * [ ] Discrete material production with progress indicator

* Milestone ? - Map
  * [ ] Zoom in and out
  * [ ] Move the map
  * [ ] Support different areas that are suited better for certain constructions (more/less material or energy)
  * [ ] Display a map in the background

* Milestone ? - Advanced Building
  * [ ] Max. connection distance
  * [ ] Building a new construction takes time and consumes energy
